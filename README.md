### Rules 

You will create a team of 3 heros and make them fight against your opponent

There are 4 class :

* Fighter : 100 life, he starts with a weapon that inflicts 10 points of damage

* Mage : 70 life, he starts with a weapon that heals 10 points of damage

* Dwarf : 60 life, he starts with a weapon that inflicts 20 points of damage

* Giant : 130 life , he starts with a weapon that inflicts 5 points of damage


It's a turn-based game where the goal is to eliminate all the opposing team


Sometimes a weapon chest appears to change weapons on a hero, you can choose to have a new weapon or keep yours


When a player eliminates all the team of his opponent the game ends with the number of turn to play
